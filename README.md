# Zome Signals

This module implements a foundation layer for a signal-based architecture for Holochain applications.
This library is to be included directly in a zome as a dependency and not be a zome in itself.

## Usage

This module defines `recv_remote_signal()` which must be initialized in your zome's `init()` callback by calling `create_signal_cap_grant()`.

This module also defines `cast_tip()` and `call_remote_app_tip()` zome functions intended to be called by UI components for sending signals to remote agents.

Use `emit_zome_signal()` in your zome functions or callbacks to send a signal to app clients.

A call to `attest_post_commit()` must be added in your zome's `post_commit()` function to receive signals during this callback.


## Core Design Principle

 Have data transmitted from zome WASM to UI primarily via *Signals* rather than
 return values of zome functions. This approach provides several benefits:

 - **Simplified UI Processing**: UI components handle data through a consistent signal
   handling mechanism regardless of where the data originates
 - **Consistency**: Since zome callbacks can only send data via signals,
   using signals for all zome-to-UI communication creates a unified approach
 - **Decoupling**: The signal pattern decouples zome function execution from UI updates

 ### Data Flow

 1. UI components register signal handlers to process incoming data
 1. UI components calls zome functions to trigger data processing
 1. During Zome functions or callbacks execution, signals containing relevant data are emitted by using a consistent signaling protocol.
 2. UI components receive the signals and process them accordingly, updating the UI 


### Validation

Each data point received by Signal has a validation marker indication how trustable the data is.

## Terminology

A **Signal** is a carrier for serialized data (`Vec<u8>`) transmitted from the zome wasm to either app clients (e.g. UI components) via `emit_signal()` or remote agents via `remote_signal()`.

When a *Signal* is used to communicate to remote agents it is called a ***Tip***.

When a *Signal* is used to communicate to app clients it is called an ***Attestation***.

A **Signal** is a data structure composed of multiple **Pulses** that together represent a complete communication message.

A *Signal* is composed of multiple **Pulses**, where each **Pulse** represents an individual data point. 


A ***System Pulse*** is a *Pulse* informing about an internal zome-agnostic event.

An ***Entry Pulse*** is a *Pulse* informing about a Zome Entry.

A ***Link Pulse*** is a *Pulse* informing about a Zome Link.

A *Signal* is **emitted**, while a *Tip* is **cast** and an *Attestation* is **attested**.



## Building
